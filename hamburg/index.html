<h1>Hamburg - Here at the Waterfront...</h1>
  <h4><em>October, 5, 2023 | by <a href="mailto:mason117167@student-schoolsofwestfield.org">Mason Quinn</a></em></h4> <hr>
    <div12><p class=lede>People visit port cities like <div3>New York,</div3> <div4>Venice </div4> and <div5>Amsterdam</div5> <em>all</em> the time. But Hamburg? Unfortunately some people may hear Hamburg and think I'm talking about a food you eat come the 4th of July, however Hamburg, Germany has such a rich history that I feel is overlooked. Besides, Hamburg has far more canals than cities like Venice... Canals help people connect with the environment, and you won't find a more perfect city that has such a unique kind of breathtaking environment to immerse yourself in than Hamburg, Germany.</p><hr>
<p>
Hamburg is a large city in northern Germany, it is one of the largest German cities with 1.8 million inhabitants. Hamburg is a hanseatic city that as it once was a participating of the hanseatic league, a group founded by northern germanic cities and some merchant groups that existed between the 12th and 19th centuries; there are 18 hanseatic cities in Germany. Hamburg Harbor is one of the biggest and largest harbors in Europe. As said before Hamburg has some of the most canals of any city in the world (the real record goes to Cape Coral, FL) - in fact there are over 2500 canals in Hamburg compared to 400 in Venice and 125 in Amsterdam. Hamburg also has the most bridges of any city in the world with over 2300 being the official count. The canals are typically used for tourism in present day, but were very important to the city in the past as they facilitated industrial growth. While Hamburg may have had a glorious and prestigious past that goes back centuries the sprawling atmosphere of the city hasn't faded one bit. It still is one of the most important cities in Germany, and it's future looks bright...</p>

  <h1>But Why Hamburg?</h1>
  <p>While there are many cities to tour in Germany none are quite like Hamburg. One of the most major differences between Hamburg and a city like Berlin is it's location on the coast. Hamburg also embraces it's traditional style far more than a city like Stuttgart, this may make Hamburg very attractive to someone who loves the architecture of old. These are just a few reasons why I think that the next time you are planning a field trip, consider <strong>Hamburg</strong>... the city's calls.</p>

                          <p>Hi, I agree and have gutted the color and am using far less italics now. Hopefully this should decrease the amount of 'spunk' on the screen. •ᴗ•</p>

                      <p>was a very good blog, was very informative and kept me entertained the whole way through, although I noticed a few small spelling errors in the blog which might be due to not proofreading, and I think it would be nice if there was more information in each section of the blog, instead of just a few sentences.</p>
