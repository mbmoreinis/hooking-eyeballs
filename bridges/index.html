  <h3> <center>How Many Human Beings?</center></h3>
  <p>The population of Hamburg is about 1.8 millon <em>inhabitants</em>, which ranks <strong>2nd in Germany</strong> behind Berlin. There is more than <strong>5 million</strong> people living in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. For being near the water, that is a lot of people for a city and a Metropolitan Region. This population and the harbor helps with the <em>economics</em> and wealth for the city of Hamburg in a great way. </p>

  <h3> <center>How Big?</center></h3>
  <p>The population in Hamburg is fairly big and the size (land) is too. The size of Hamburg is <strong>292 square miles (755 square Kilometers)</strong>, which ranks 2nd, just behind Berlin again. In comparison, that is more than 3 times the size of Boston, Massachusetts and just about the same size as New York City! A portion of this size comes from the over 2,500 bridges that are located in Hamburg. That is more bridges than in Amsterdam, Venice, and London combined!</p>

  <h3> <center>Any Good Food?</center></h3>
  <p>As expected, the idea for the piece of meat that later became the hamburger was developed it Hamburg. However, the sandwich itself is a total American thing --- stolen from Germany. When visiting Hamburg, you probably wouldn't want a hamburger because of some of the terrific foods that are served there. Due to being on a river and having an ocean nearby, they have some of the <em>freshest</em> fish in Germany. They are also some of the healthy people in the world. Here are some examples of there most <strong>flavorful dishes</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>Fried Plaice (flatfish)</li>
    <li>Knackwurst (sausage)</li>
    <li>Rundstück (bread roll)</li>
    <li>Rote Grütze (Red Berry Pudding)</li>
  </ul></p>

                  <p>It was a very good blog. It was very informative and kept me entertained the whole way through, although I noticed a few small spelling errors in the blog, which might be due to not proofreading, and I think it would be nice if there was more information in each section of the blog, instead of just a few sentences.
